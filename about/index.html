    Taylor Clark is a student in the honors program at Fordham University majoring in computer science and minoring in French. 
    This project was created for the midterm creativity assignment for her Honors Sacred Texts class. This assignment called for
    students to “express some aspect of the positive, ambiguous, or negative dimensions of hospitality” using the creative medium
    of their choice. Taylor sought to combine what she has learned in this class with her love of computer science and French to 
    complete this project, and she thanks you for viewing and supporting her vision.
